      <p className="c1"><span className="c0">By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Site in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based tokens such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20), and blockchain-based software systems.</span>
      </p>
      <p className="c1 c3"><span className="c0"></span></p>
      <p className="c1"><span className="c0">The Company does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the underlying software for blockchain networks tends to be open source such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Company is not responsible for operation of the underlying software and networks that there exists no guarantee of functionality, security, or availability of such software and networks; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as &ldquo; Forks &rdquo;), and that such Forks may materially affect the Services. It might be discretionarily decided not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked network entirely. You acknowledge and agree that Company assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of any underlying software protocols, whether Forked or not.</span>
      </p>
      <p className="c1 c3"><span className="c0"></span></p>
      <p className="c1"><span className="c0">Underlying networks use public/private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). Company does not have access to your private key(s). Losing control of your private key will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to funds on the Ethereum blockchain or other network. Neither Company nor any other person will be able to retrieve or protect your funds. Once your private key(s) is lost, you will not be able to transfer your Digital Assets to any other address or wallet. If this occurs, you will not be able to realize any value or utility that you may hold now or in future.</span>
